Constructor : 
constructor is a special function which has same name as class name
and it must not have any return type

constructor is used to initialize instance variable. 

you don't need to invoke manually , constructor will call 
automatically when we create object. 


there are three types of constructor we have in cpp 

1) default / no arg constructor 
2) parameterized / argument constructor 
3) copy constructor 


default / no arg constructor 

Employee(){
    basicSalary = 0
    hra = 0; 
    bonus = 0; 
}

argument/parameterized 

Employee(int basic,int h,int bn,int ts){
    basicSalary  = basic; 
    hra = h; 
    bonus = bn; 
}


Employee(int basic){
    basicSalary  = basic; 
    calculateSalary();
}

Employee e; 
Employee x(5000,1000,2000,256000)
Employee j(10000);
